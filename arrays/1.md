# Arrays

## Task 1 - Declaring an Array

Convert these lists of things into JavaScript arrays.

E.G.

### Example: Favorite Foods

- Cheese
- Chocolate
- Olives
- Anchovies

Would become...

```js
const favoriteFoods = ["Cheese", "Chocolate", "Olives", "Anchovies"];
```

ðŸ‘‰ You do the rest!

### 1. Favorite Songs

- Tiny Dancer
- Running Up That Hill
- Don't Stop Moving

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```js
const favoriteSongs = [
  "Tiny Dancer",
  "Running Up That Hill",
  "Don't Stop Moving",
  "Tragedy",
  "Crazy Horses",
];
```

</details>

### 2. Profit From First Seven Days of Chris' Penny Doubling Pyramid Scheme

```js
const socTeam = [
  { name: "Ben", specialSkill: "code rapping" },
  { name: "Tao", specialSkill: "hand raising" },
  { name: "Lizzie", specialSkill: "being friendly" },
  { name: "Liz.K", specialSkill: "crotchet" },
  { name: "Mell", specialSkill: "winning quizzes" },
  { name: "Chris", specialSkill: "changing lives" },
  { name: "Tim", specialSkill: "kitchen based analogies" },
  { name: "James", specialSkill: "mannequin friendship" },
  { name: "Banwo", specialSkill: "having accidents" },
];
```

## Task 2 - Reading Array Values

```js
let options = [
  "Jan",
  "Feb",
  "Mar",
  "Apr",
  "May",
  "Jun",
  "Jul",
  "Aug",
  "Sep",
  "Oct",
  "Nov",
  "Dec",
];
```

Using bracket notation and the correct index...

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log the month in which you were born.

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log the month your mother was born.

ðŸ‘‰ Console.log your favorite month.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```js
console.log(options[6]); // July
console.log(options[0]); // Jan
console.log(options[11]); // December
```

</details>

## Task 3 - Looping and Accessing

We can use the useful loops we learnt yesterday to access the items in an array.

```js
let englishNumbers = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];
```

ðŸ‘‰ Declare an index variable and assign it the value of 0.

ðŸ‘‰ In a while loop, console.log the array item at the current index and add 1 to the index variable.

ðŸ‘‰ Have the while loop until the index is equal to or greater than the array's length property.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```js
let index = 0;

while (index < englishNumbers.length) {
  console.log(englishNumbers[index]);
  index++;
}
```

</details>

## Task 4 - Looping and Accessing

ðŸ‘‰ Refactor task three to use a for loop instead of a while loop.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```js
for (let index = 0; index < englishNumbers.length; index++) {
  console.log(englishNumbers[index]);
}
```

</details>

## Task 5 - Looping and Reassigning

```js
let words = ["ben", "ha", "spla", "fa", "ca", "dra"];
// for loop goes here

console.log(words);
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use a for loop to iterate over the words array and add the letter t to the end of each word.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```js
for (let index = 0; index < words.length; index++) {
  words[index] = `${words[index]}t`;
}
```
