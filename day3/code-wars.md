# Codewars 101

## Task 1

Visit [code wars](https://www.codewars.com/join?language=javascript) and fix the function to be allowed entry to the site. You can then sign up with your GitHub account. There are many "kata" on the site, which are small coding challenges. Challenges have 8 levels of difficulty, 8 is the least challenging and 1 is the most. We will start with the 8s! Begin your codewars journey with the selected kata below.

## Task 2

To be completed as a pair, each 5 mins switch who is navigating and who is driving. The driver should be sharing their screen and the navigator should be talking. Use [the google timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer) to help you stick to 5 mins intervals!

## 1. The wide mouth frog

You will have all the skills necessary to do this kata. Once navigating to the page you will find an empty function called `mouthSize` like this...

```js
function mouthSize(animal) {
  // code here
}
```

All the code you write will be in this function, the instructions for what the function must do are in the left hand side panel under instructions. Read the instructions carefully and then formulate your plan. Write the plan in pseudo code comments in the coding window before you start translating your logic into JavaScript. Without the right logic, the code will never work!

Once you are happy with your plan, and have started translating to code, you can check that your code works by running tests. To do this, press the `TEST` button at the bottom right hand side of the screen. This will run some automated checks on your code and give you the result in the output panel. **Use this output to help you**.

It may be hard to read at first but patiently read the output and you will be able to work out where your code is going wrong.

Your rhythm should be this...

- Read and understand the problem
- Write a plan

- Write some code
- Run the test
- See what the error is
- Alter the plan?
- Write some code
- Run the test
- See what the error is
- Alter the plan?
- Write some code
- Run the test
- See what the error is
- Alter the plan?
- etc...

Once all the tests pass when you press `TEST`, and your are happy that your code solved the problem set in the brief, you can click `ATTEMPT`. This will run a larger set of tests and usually focuses more on some small edge cases that will have been mentioned in the problem. Once again, see what the error is, alter the plan if needed and refactor your code before running the test again.

## 4. Hello Name or World

This one is a slightly more complex and you will need to lookup changing the casing of strings to pass all the tests. Give it a go!

## 5. Try some more!

Stick to 8 kyu kata and if you get totally stuck then move on to another. We will be learning many more skills that will help us solve the more complex tasks.
